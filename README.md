This app maintain Firestore Cloud Databse backend side. 
I use this to store a list of documents, which I have named in my code as "Place" //Place.swift// 
For understanding this code you must have a sense with: basic Firebase work experience, MVVM architecture, MapKit, Combine frameworks, SwiftUI elements.
Includes Rest api for fetching country dial codes.// declared in MainViewModel.swift//
